# We import the Flask class, the request object and jsonify from the flask package.

# Flask is the class that we’ll use to instantiate the Flask application. 

# We handle user requests in the form of the request object and we’ll use jsonify to return json responses from our request handler function, called index

# After the import lines, we use app = Flask(__name__) to create a Flask application instance.

# With redis = Redis(host="redis", db=0, socket_timeout=5, charset="utf-8", decode_responses=True) we create a Redis interface instance in our application

# The rest of the code defines a route that we can send requests to from a browser or an API client like Postman or curl.

# You can send an http POST request to the application with data in the form {"name" : "<some_name>" } to the URI "/" and the app will add a new entry to the end of the students list in Redis.

# Sending an http GET request to the "/" URI will retrieve and return the list of students in the Redis store.
